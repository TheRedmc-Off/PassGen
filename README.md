# Password Generator

This project is a simple password generator, but it is very secure.
Please take note that it is my first python project to be published, so tell me if there's anything wrong!
This script is only compatible with Windows 10 or 11 (or any Windows OS that is up-to-date and where latest python version is installed).
Please go and see the Roadmap section for more information about incoming features!
